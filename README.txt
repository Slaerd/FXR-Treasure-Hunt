This is the file containing the instructions for the Treasure HuntAR game created by Kevin Ratovo and Nathan Schoech.

The images targets used in this project had a base width of 0.15 meters, so the targets containing two or three smaller targets are twice or thrice the size.
The targets are all in the same database which was imported in the Unity project.

The player has to find the pieces in the room, and assemble them in a specific order so as to see the treasure appear.
It is the player's phone which will be used as the camera, hence displaying the 3D models according to the target in front of them.
